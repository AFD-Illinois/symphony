# symphony

This code, *symphony*, calculates synchrotron emissivition and absorption coefficients polarized in the Stokes basis {I, Q, U, V}.  It does this explicitly for three momentum-space electron distributions (dN/d^3p): a relativistic thermal (Maxwell-JÃ¼ttner) distribution, a nonthermal power-law distribution, and a kappa distribution.
